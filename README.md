# Tingfinderen
Tingfinderen is a 3rd semester group project in my Multimedia degree. I have mainly been responsible for the coding of the website.
The website is a responsive webshop. Product- og logininformation is stored in a MySQL database, and PHP is used for the backend.

I have also made another branch of the project with search-friendly URL's for SEO.
